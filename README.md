A custom resource that displays data as a Spreadsheet

This plugin mimics a spreadsheet interface so you easily edit data

To create a sheet do the following: "New Resource..." ->  "gsheet (gsheet.gd)" -> Create

You can import both CSV files and Dictionaries from Godot from the "import" option in the interface (see video)
Note that the CSV files need to be comma seperated and will start to be slow after 1000 entries
